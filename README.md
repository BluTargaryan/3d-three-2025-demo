- Orbit controls for camera manipulation
- Responsive canvas that adapts to window size
- Multiple 3D objects (Dodecahedron and Box)
- Dynamic lighting and materials

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the 3D scene.

## Project Structure

- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main page with basic Three.js setup
- `src/app/ReactTestDemo/page.tsx` - Demo page with interactive 3D objects and orbit controls

## Controls

- Left Mouse Button: Rotate camera
- Right Mouse Button: Pan camera
- Mouse Wheel: Zoom in/out

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 14
- Three.js
- TypeScript
- React

## Development

You can start editing the pages by modifying the files in the `src/app` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the files.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
